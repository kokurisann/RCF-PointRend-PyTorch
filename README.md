# RCF-PointRend-PyTorch

### RCF-PointRend-PyTorch

Thanks to Li Liang's help.
The best result of my pytorch model is 0.783 ODS F-score now.


### Introduction

The result of my pytorch model will be released in the future

| Method        | ODS F-score on BSDS500 dataset |
| :------------ | :----------------------------: |
| RCF-PointRend |             0.807              |
| RCF           |             0.806              |


### Installation

Install <a href="https://pytorch.org/">pytorch</a>. The code is tested under 11.6 cuda version and Python 3.9  on Ubuntu 20.04. There are also some dependencies for a few Python libraries for data processing and visualizations like `cv2` etc. It's highly recommended that you have access to GPUs.

### Usage

#### Image edge detection

To train a RCF-PointRend model on BSDS500:

        python train_RCF_PointRend.py

To resume the training on BSDS500:


	python train_RCF_PointRend.py --checkpoint '[.pth file]'


If you have multiple GPUs on your machine, you can also run the multi-GPU version training:

        CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python train_multi_gpu.py --num_gpus 2
